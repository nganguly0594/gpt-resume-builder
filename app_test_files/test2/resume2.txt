Skills: java, python, c++, css, html. i also have used keras, tensorflow, sass, and i also know how to use git

Education History:
i go to uiuc, my expected graduation is in may of 2026, I'm getting a bachelor in science in CS, and some cool courses I'm taking are Data Structures, Linear Algebra, and Computer Architecture.

Work Experience:
i worked at a company called innoviTech solutions as a software enginner intern where i worked from may to august in 2022 and i completed a project where i used the scikit-lean models to create classifiers and regressor models and preproces data and i worked with python libraries like pandas, numppy, matplotlib, seborn, and scipi.

i worked as a software enginner intern at physicore labs may 2020 â€“ aug 2020. i completed a mentor-supervised project based on argonne national lab's analysis of the performance of beam position moniters. this project involved visualizing, filtering, and analyzing data, as well as performing svd factorization to simplify data into smaller matrics.

Projects:
i completed a project called CipherWave X from january of 2023 to may where i developed a birdfeeder which had a raspberry pi module and i used the tensorflow and keras libraries to implement a convolutional neural network that could identify birds and squirrels.

in august 2022, i collaborated with a team of four to develop a basic machine learning object detection model for self-driving cars in a project called SynthoScan pro. our project involved multiple methods, such as sliding window image classification, perceptron models, transfer learning, and real-time video classification using yolo.
